 PROJECT SETUP
 Requirements : Visual studio code
                Platform IO IDE
                
Hardware Connection : ESP32-WROOM 3V3  --->  DHT VCC
                      ESP32-WROOM GND  --->  DHT GND
                      ESP32-WROOM GPIO4 --->  DHT DATA
                      10k pull-up resistor between DATA and VCC (many DHT modules already include this)
How to build :   Clone the github repo by running :
                                                  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Test1.git
                                                  cd Test1
